// Modify the broker.c program of Section 5.2 by making both of the following changes:
//  a. Ask the user to enter the number of shares and the
//       price per share, instead of the value of the trade.

//    b. Add statements that compute the commission charged by
//       a rival broker ($33 plus 3 cents per share for fewer
//       than 2000 shares; $33 plus 2 cents per share for 2000
//       shares or more. Display the rival's commission as well
//       as the commission charged by the original broker.
