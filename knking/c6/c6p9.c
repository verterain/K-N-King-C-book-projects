//    Programming Project 8 in Chapter 2 asked you to write a
//    program that calculates the remaining balance on a loan
//    after the first, second, and third monthly payments.
//    Modify the program so that it also asks the user to enter
//    the number of payments and then displays the balance
//    remaining after each of these payments.
